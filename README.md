# Task Management System
The project is a Task Management System designed for efficiently creating, assigning, and tracking tasks within teams or among users. It utilizes a .NET Core backend with a Web API, following an N-Layered architecture and the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern. Here's a comprehensive summary:

Project Overview:

Objective: Develop a robust Task Management System.
Architecture: N-Layered architecture with CQRS.
Backend Technology: .NET Core Web API.
Database: Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for data access.
User Management: Utilizes ASP.NET Identity for user authentication and authorization.
Database Design: Includes tables for tasks, users, teams, task assignments, comments, and attachments.
Key Features: Task creation, assignment, status tracking, team management, user management, and task comments and attachments.
Data Relationships: Users can belong to multiple teams, and tasks can be associated with multiple users or teams.
Security: Ensures data privacy and security through user authentication and role-based access control.
Data Integrity: Enforces data integrity and consistency through database relationships and validations.
Scalability: Designed for scalability with support for multiple teams and users.
Customization: Allows users to customize tasks with priorities, due dates, descriptions, and attachments.
Archiving: Supports archiving completed or closed tasks.
Logging: Logs user activities and system events for auditing and troubleshooting.
Multi-Tenancy Support: Can accommodate multiple organizations or tenants with isolated data.
Database Tables:

User: Represents system users with authentication details and roles.
Team: Represents groups of users.
Task: Stores task information, including title, description, status, priority, due date, creator, assignees, team association, and comments/attachments.
Comment: Contains task-related comments with user associations.
Attachment: Stores file attachments linked to tasks.
Team-User Relationship (UserTeam): Allows users to belong to multiple teams.
Task-User Relationship (UserTask): Links users to tasks for assignments.
Task-Team Relationship (TeamTask): Links teams to tasks for assignments.
User Interface:

Frontend technologies (React) can be used to create user-friendly interfaces for interacting with the system.
Conclusion:
This Task Management System provides a flexible and feature-rich solution for managing tasks, enabling organizations and teams to collaborate efficiently, track progress, and maintain a structured workflow. It supports user authentication, role-based access control, data relationships, and customization while ensuring data security and integrity. Additionally, its scalable design can cater to the needs of organizations with varying sizes and complexities.
